# Notes

Just a place to store arbitrary information, TODOs and so on.
Maybe, it is concept for later documentation, or just keep-up-the-good-work (`kutgw`).

## Ideas

-   Move aliases out of `shellrc` because they are independent -> more flexibility
-   For __prompt__: function for changing prompt
-   For `python`: Add somewhere: `pip install $(pip list --outdated | awk '{ print $1 }') --upgrade`
-   Add vscode (vim-)keybindings to `README.md`
-   `dotfiles`: print info of all features and new functionality
-   Alert
    -   Add usage description to alert function (sound arg)
    -   Add message to alert as input arg
-   `vscode`: add snippets
-   Maybe: Let __github-actions__ merge automatically when no commit has happened (meaning that everything works for days and is ready to publish).
-   Maybe: use enabled-directory for symlinking into shell-folders to enable/disable modules (eg emacs-aliases or whatever) similar to Apache2

## Some notes from earlier (kutgw, could be trash)
