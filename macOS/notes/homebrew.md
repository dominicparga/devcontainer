# Homebrew notes

## keg-only

- [very poor comment on that by brew itself..](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#what-does-keg-only-mean)
- [stackoverflow explanation, quite helpful](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4691403/keg-only-homebrew-formulas)
- [github issues explanation, less helpful but may help]https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/11091
